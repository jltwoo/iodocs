Features introduced  in this branch:
====================================

Bookmarks
---------
Endpoints and methods are now links. When the url entered is a linked item, that item will be expanded upon page load.

Search
------
Whatever term is typed into the search box, that term will be searched for in the json configuration file; API names (endpoint names) are not included in the search [probably something that should be changed].

Split Configuration
-------------------
This function was developed with the assumption that the starting input
would be the main api file, which would look like the following:

```js
{ "endpoints":
    [...]
}
```

The include statement syntax looks like this:

```js
{
    "external": {
        "href": "./api_name/data.json",
        "type": "list"
    }
}
```

```js
{
    "external": {
        "href": "file:///user/home/api.json",
    }
}
```

"type": "list" is used only when the contents of the file to be included is a list object 
that will be merged into an existing list. 
An example would be storing all the get methods for an endpoint as a list of objects in 
an external file.

API Description Anywhere
------------------------
If one has a sufficiently large API that splitting it up would make it more
manageable, perhaps it would be nice to have the API description stored in a
seperate repository, and imported as a sub-module. (To my knowledge) git 
sub-modules can only exist in the top level directory of a project.

This feature allows you to define where to look for an API description file,
beyond the default location of '/public/data/' in the IODocs installation 
directory.

Example configuration:
```js
"requestbin": {
    "name": "Requestb.in",
    "protocol": "http",
    "baseURL": "requestb.in",
    "publicPath": "/",
    "href": "file:///user/home/api/"
}
```
Given the above configuration, when looking for the API description file,
instead of looking in 'IODocs/public/data/', it will look in '/user/home/api'.
This works well with the split configuration feature. If the 'href' property
is not defined in the config file, the default location of 'IODocs/public/data/'
will be used instead.

This feature is currently only setup for files on disk, but could be adapted to
using descriptions located on the web as well.

Future functionality:
    { "href": "http://www.example.com/foo.json" }
The function would return the parsed JSON data from foo.json, dealing
with file retrieval from the web.

PUT and POST content body
=========================
### Replaces jQuery 1.6 with jQuery 1.9.0
Content parameters show what can be entered for POST and PUT methods. When a method's parameters are filled out, the method's corresponding text area will show what the JSON form would look like.

*Note*: Perhaps there's a better term than 'content parameters', but I do not know it. I call them such as they appear under the word 'Content' in the display, and in the 'content' block in the api description file.

*Note 2*: 'content' and 'contentType' are two variables introduced in this fork by @dgc-wh to be able to send the content body as part of PUT and POST requests. 'content' replaces the 'requestBody' variable.

A few new types are introduced specifically for content parameters.
* collection - a list of objects belonging to a property. eg - "collection" : [{ "prop": "val", "prop2": "val2" }, { "prop3": "val3", "prop4": "val4" }]
* object - a set of properties and values belonging to a single property. eg. - "obj" : { "prop": "val", "prop2": "val2" }
* list - a list of values belonging to a property. eg. - "list" : [ "val", "val2", "val3" ]

Here is an example api that shows usage of all of these new types. 

```js
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "name": "Testing API",
            "methods": [

I/O Docs - Open Source in Node.js
=================================
Copyright 2012-2013 Mashery, Inc.

[http://www.mashery.com](http://www.mashery.com)

[http://developer.mashery.com](http://developer.mashery.com)

SYNOPSIS
--------
I/O Docs is a live interactive documentation system for RESTful web APIs. By defining APIs at the resource, method and parameter
levels in a JSON schema, I/O Docs will generate a JavaScript client interface. API calls can be executed from this interface, which are then proxied through the I/O Docs server with payload data cleanly formatted (pretty-printed if JSON or XML). Basic HTML text tags are enabled in the JSON schema.

You can find the latest version here: [https://github.com/mashery/iodocs](https://github.com/mashery/iodocs)

However, we recommend that you install I/O Docs with *npm*, the Node package manager. See instructions below.

BUILD/RUNTIME DEPENDENCIES
--------------------------
1. Node.js - server-side JS engine
2. npm - node package manager
3. Redis - key+value storage engine 

Build note: If you're not using a package manager, Node and some of the modules require compiler (like gcc). If you are on a Mac, you will need to install XCode. If you're on Linux, you'll need to install build-essentials, or something equivalent.

Redis note: Redis is considered a runtime dependency. It is used to store OAuth information server side. If you are not implementing OAuth, redis is not required. You can simply remove the redis block from config.json. However, if you do implement OAuth down the road, you will need to use Redis, otherwise you will see 500 errors during the auth dance.

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR NODE, NPM & REDIS
-----------------------------------------------
1. Node.js - [https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation](https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/Installation)
2. npm (Node package manager) - [https://github.com/isaacs/npm](https://github.com/isaacs/npm)
3. Redis - [http://redis.io/download](http://redis.io/download)

INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR I/O DOCS
--------------------------------------
From the command line type in:
<pre>  git clone http://github.com/mashery/iodocs.git
  cd iodocs
  npm install
</pre>


### Node Module Dependencies
These will be automatically installed when you use any of the above *npm* installation methods above.

1. [express](http://expressjs.com/) - framework
2. [oauth](https://github.com/ciaranj/node-oauth) - oauth library
3. [redis](https://github.com/mranney/node_redis) - connector to Redis
3. [connect-redis](https://github.com/visionmedia/connect-redis) - Redis session store
4. [querystring](https://github.com/visionmedia/node-querystring) - used to parse query string
5. [jade](http://jade-lang.com/) - the view engine
6. [supervisor](https://github.com/isaacs/node-supervisor) - restart node upon an error or changed javascript file

Note: hashlib is no longer a required module -- we're using the internal crypto module for signatures and digests.

RUNNING I/O DOCS
----------------
**Create your config** file by copying the default config:

```
cp config.json.sample config.json
```
The defaults will work, but feel free to change them.

**Run a Redis instance:**

```
redis-server
```

**Start I/O Docs**:

```
npm start (*nix, Mac OSX)
npm run-script startwin (Windows)
```

**Start I/O Docs with a custom config file**:

```
./node_modules/.bin/supervisor -e 'js|json' -- app --config-file ../config.json (*nix, Mac OSX)
supervisor -e 'js' -- app --config-file ../config.json (Windows)
```

Ideally, the `--config-file` arg would be possible to use with `npm start`, but until
[npm issue #3494](https://github.com/isaacs/npm/issues/3494) is resolved, this is not supported.

**Point your browser** to: [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

CONFIGURING API DEFINITION LOCATION
-----------------------------------
API definitions are, by default, stored in `./public/data/` and described by `./public/data/apiconfig.json`. This can
be overridden in `config.json` by setting the `"apiConfigDir"` property.


BASIC AUTH FOR SERVER
---------------------
Enabling HTTP basic authentication on the server is simple. By default, the username and password values are empty ("").

1. Open up *config.json*
2. Navigate down to the *basicAuth* object
3. Add values for username and password within the object


QUICK API CONFIGURATION EXAMPLE
-------------------------------
Adding an API to the I/O Docs configuration is relatively simple.

First, append the new top-level service information to the `./public/data/apiconfig.json` file.

Example:
   
```js
"lowercaseapi": {
    "name": "Lower Case API",
    "protocol": "http",
    "baseURL": "api.lowercase.sample.com",
    "publicPath": "/v1",
    "auth": "key",
    "keyParam": "api_key_var_name",
    "headers": {
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

Add the file `./public/data/lowercaseapi.json` to define the API.

Example:
   
```js
{
    "endpoints": [
        {
            "name": "Resource Group A",
            "methods": [
                {
                    "MethodName": "Method A1",
                    "Synopsis": "Grabs information from the A1 data set",
                    "HTTPMethod": "GET",
                    "URI": "/a1/grab",
                    "RequiresOAuth": "N",
                    "parameters": [
                        {
                            "Name": "param_1_name",
                            "Required": "Y",
                            "Default": "",
                            "Type": "string",
                            "Description": "Description of the first parameter."
                        }
                    ]
                },
                {
                    "MethodName": "Method A1 User",
                    "Synopsis": "Grabs information from the A1 data set for a specific user",
                    "HTTPMethod": "GET",
                    "URI": "/a1/grab/:userId",
                    "RequiresOAuth": "N",
                    "parameters": [
                        {
                            "Name": "param_1_name",
                            "Required": "Y",
                            "Default": "",
                            "Type": "string",
                            "Description": "Description of the first parameter."
                        },
                        {
                            "Name": "userId",
                            "Required": "Y",
                            "Default": "",
                            "Type": "string",
                            "Description": "The userId parameter that is in the URI."
                        }
                    ]
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

By default the parameters are added to the query string. But if the URI contains a named variable, it will substitute the value in the path.

TOP-LEVEL SERVICE CONFIG DETAILS - apiconfig.json
-------------------------------------------------
The *apiconfig.json* file contains high-level information about an API.

### Example #1 - Explanation of each field in an example API config that uses basic key authentication:

```js
"lower": {
    "name": "My API",
    "protocol": "http",
    "baseURL": "api.lowercase.sample.com",
    "publicPath": "/v1",
    "auth": "key",
    "keyParam": "api_key_var_name",
    "headers": {
                "Accept": "application/json",
                "Foo": "bar"
    }
}
```

Line:

1. Handle of the API. It is used to pull up the client 
   interface in the URL:

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:3000/lower

2. "name" key value is a string that holds the name
    of the API that is used in the Jade template output.

3. "protocol" key value is either *http* or *https*

4. "baseURL" key value is the host name of
    the API calls (should not include protocol)

5. "publicPath" key value is the full path prefix prepended
    to all method URIs. This value often includes the version
    in RESTful APIs.

    Ex: "/v1"

    In the Example #3 below, there is also "privatePath"
    which is used for endpoints behind protected resources.

6. "auth" key value is the auth method. Valid values can be:

         "key" - simple API key in the URI
         "oauth1" - OAuth 1.0/1.0a
         "" - no authentication

7. "keyParam" key value is name of the query parameter that
    is added to an API request when the "auth" key value from
    (5) is set to "key".

8. "headers" object contains key value pairs of HTTP headers
    that will be sent for each request for API. These are
    static key/value pairs.

12. Closing curly-bracket ;)

### Example #2 - Explanation of each field in an example API config that uses basic key authentication with signatures (signed call).

```js
"upper": {
   "name": "Upper API",
   "protocol": "http",
   "baseURL": "api.upper.sample.com",
   "publicPath": "/v3",
   "auth": "key",
   "keyParam": "api_key_var_name",
   "signature": {
      "type": "signed_md5",
      "sigParam": "sig",
      "digest": "hex"  
   }
}
```

Line:

1. Handle of the API. It is used to pull up the client 
   interface in the URL:

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:3000/upper

2. "name" key value is a string that holds the name
    of the API that is used in the Jade template output.

3. "protocol" key value is either *http* or *https*

4. "baseURL" key value is the host name of
    the API calls (should not include protocol)

5. "publicPath" key value is the full path prefix prepended
    to all method URIs. This value often includes the version
    in RESTful APIs.

    Ex: "/v3"

    In the Example #3 below, there is also "privatePath"
    which is used for endpoints behind protected resources.

6. "auth" key value is the auth method. Valid values can be:

         "key" - simple API key in the URI
         "oauth1" - OAuth 1.0/1.0a
         "" - no authentication

7. "keyParam" key value is the name of the query parameter that
    is added to an API request when the "auth" key value from
    (5) is set to "key"

8. "signature" is a JSON object that contains the details about
   the API call signing requirements. The signature routine coded
   in app.js is a hash of the string concatenation of API key, 
   API key secret and timestamp (epoch).

9. "type" key value is either *signed_md5* or *signed_sha256*.
   More signature methods are available with crypto.js, but have
   not been included in the code as options.

10. "sigParam" key value is the name of the query parameter that
    is added to an API request that holds the digital signature.

11. "digest" key value is the digest algorithm that is used.
    Values can be *hex*, *base64* or *binary*.

12. Closing curly-bracket for the "signature" object

13. Closing curly bracket for main object.

### Example #3 - Twitter API config that uses 3-legged OAuth

```js
"twitter": {
    "name": "Twitter API",
    "protocol": "http",
    "baseURL": "api.twitter.com",
    "publicPath": "/1",
    "privatePath": "/1",
    "booleanTrueVal": "true",
    "booleanFalseVal": "false",
    "auth": "oauth",
    "oauth" : {
       "type": "three-legged",
       "requestURL": "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/request_token",
       "signinURL": "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/authorize?oauth_token=",
       "accessURL": "https://api.twitter.com/oauth/access_token",
       "version": "1.0",
       "crypt": "HMAC-SHA1"
   },
   "keyParam": ""
}
```

Line:

1. Handle of the API. It is used to pull up the client
    interface in the URL:

    Ex: http://127.0.0.1:3000/twitter

2. "name" key value is a string that holds the name
    of the API that is used in the Jade template output.

3. "protocol" key value contains either *http* or *https*,
    but you're welcome to try other protocols.

4. "baseURL" key value is the base URL that accepts
    the API calls (should not include protocol)

5. "publicPath" key value is the path prefix prepended
    to all method URIs for non-protected method resources.
    This value often includes the version in RESTful APIs.

    Ex: "/v1", "/1", etc.

6. "privatePath" key value is the path prefix prepended
    to all method URIs for OAuth protected method resources.
    This value is most often the version in RESTful APIs.

    Ex: "/v1", "/1", etc.

7. "booleanTrueVal" key value is the default value for
    true Boolean values that are sent in API requests.
    Some APIs are designed to accept a wide variety
    of true derivatives, but some are very strict about
    this value.

    Ex: "true", "TRUE", "True", "t", "T", "1", etc.
    Default: "true"

8. "booleanFalseVal" key value is the default value for
    false Boolean values that are sent in API requests.
    Some APIs are designed to accept a wide variety
    of false derivatives, but some are very strict about
    this value.

    Ex: "false", "FALSE", "False", "f", "F", "0", etc.
    Default: "false"

9. "auth" key value is set to "oauth" when OAuth is the
    authentication mechanism. Field is required.

10. "oauth" key value is a JSON object that contains the
    OAuth implementation details for this API. Field is
    required when "auth" value is "oauth".

11. "type" key value is the OAuth is the authorization flow
     used for this API. Valid values are "three-legged" (normal
     authorization flow) and "two-legged" (no authorization flow).

12. "requestURL" key value is the Request Token URL used in
    the OAuth dance (used in *three-legged* scenario).

13. "signinURL" key value is the User Authorization URL used
    in the OAuth dance (where the user is redirected to provide
    their credentials -- used in *three-legged* scenario).

14. "accessURL" key value is the Access Token URL used in the
    OAuth dance (used in *three-legged* scenario).

15. "version" key value is the OAuth version. As of I/O Docs v1.1,
    "1.0" is the only supported version. Note: use "1.0" for both
    1.0 and 1.0A implementations.

16. "crypt" key value is the OAuth signature method. As of I/O Docs
    v1.1 "HMAC-SHA1" is the only supported signing method.

17. Closing curly bracket for "oauth" JSON object.

18. "keyParam" key value is blank when OAuth is the authentication
    method.

19. Closing curly bracket for main object.

    found here: "http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6749". 

12. "baseSite" key value is the base website URL used in
    the OAuth 2 dance. It is required.

13. "authorizeURL" key value is the url string used to 
    retrieve the authorization token in the 
    "authorization-code" OAuth 2 flow. This is not necessary 
    in any other OAuth 2 flow.

    as the default token name when making calls with the 
    access token in the url query parameters. Not required if 
    "access_token" is used. 

16. "authorizationHeader" must by "Y" if the access (Bearer)
    token is sent through the request header as 
    "Authorization: Bearer access_token". Only required if this
    is the case.

17. Closing curly bracket for "oauth2" JSON object. 

18. "keyParam" key value is blank when OAuth 2 is the authentication
    method.

19. Closing curly bracket for main object.

Additional Note: All redirect URIs for the Foursquare API & your 
Foursqare app must be set through the Foursquare developer site. 
For the iodocs Foursquare API test these URIs are :
"http://localhost:3000/foursquare", "http://localhost:3000/oauth2Success/foursquare"

For the Rdio API test, beta access to their new API is necessary. 
The site for the beta API is: "http://www.rdio.com/developers/"



API-LEVEL CONFIG DETAILS
========================
For every API that is configured in *apiconfig.json* a JSON config file must exist.
You should look at the *./public/data/* directory for examples.  

### Example #1 - Explanation of each field in an example API-level configuration

```js
{
   "name":"User Resources",
   "methods":[
      {

         "HTTPMethod":"GET",
         "URI":"/users/show.json",
         "RequiresOAuth":"N",
         "parameters":[
